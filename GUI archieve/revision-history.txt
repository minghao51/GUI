GUI revision history
Note, all GUI require otsu.m to function
Note, GUIv3 required sort_na to read through some folders due to the unreasonable names they have.
* demands fix or attention still

23/2/14 GUIv1 
Loading, Cropping, Otsu are working, though I'm achieving to tidying. To eliminate the use of global variables.
Change of global parameters Into  
> dicomlist, data, I1, I2 
> handles.dicomlist , handles.data, handles.I1, handles.I2
couldn't get any other work.data to be shared along the various function for some reasons. Hence I used handles.xxx for everything atm

24/2/14 GUIv2
PostResult are working as intended, implemented
Depicting frames Number on the static textbox
Updating centroid location on each plot with sliders
Considering removing the cropped portion of image, as they are just taking up space, and I could use a static textbox to display feedback or error msg.

4/3/14 -26/2/14 GUIv3 
SCRAPPECD - Remove the cropped image display to make room for a static textbox
>Log Panel - added a Log Panel and static textbox to display exceptions and error
>Error Check - Implemented an error clipping check that is based on a the range of displacement of centroid, Having different value for diaphragm and tumour as their motion are quite different
>File Loader - It's now able to load all kinds of file names, while ignoring those that doesn't share the same first letter
>Sort_na - Using a code I found online, sort those the dicom files to ensure I have the correct order. As their filename may not follow a easy readable format.
>Custom Threshold  - Functional now at Threshold method 3, seems very instable, very dependence on the impixel value.
>Custom Otsu - Applying Otsu method only at the cropped image, seems much more accurate than Applying Even-Otsu, as it is able to circulate through the very high intensity of heart area in the dicom image.
>DicomInfo - handles.dicominfo to read the temporal and spatial data, as we only use pixel location and N frame atm
>Probability density Map (PDF, PDM ) output as a plot at the end with contourd
>Volume of tumour output at the end
>Crop coordinates, threshold region are now save in 'predata.txt' and it will be saved with the corresponding folder with the image
the problem will also read for predata and cropped region if the 'predata.txt' is available
>Seperated data and dataT, ie the original image data and the thresholded data, though it seems I can't just threshold twice still.*
>Overlay of Tracked region on the original image to access accuracy.
> Change, Otsu > Threshold for more accurate portray of actions
And some others that I couldn't remember


GUI
cor pat require bwareopen ~ 25 to track the diaphragm consistently
sag pat require bwareaopen 100 to track the diaphragm, but didn't work for other, odd
It also doesn't display the contoured region, likely an error due to not printing properly?

Yet to implement
> Output of time, displacement, Ctumour-x, Ctumour-y, Diaphragm-y, Volume of Tumour into a text file
> PDF output in Dicom, would require accessment of reproducibility of PDF before this I guess
> Perhaps another code/function to access the reproducibility of PDF
> Remove the cropping cordinates in the GUI, as it has little use.
